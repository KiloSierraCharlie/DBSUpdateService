# Disclosure & Barring Service (DBS) Update Service
A PHP library for interacting with the DBS update service API.
*Please â˜… this package if you found it useful :)*

## Installation
The recommended way to install this library is [through Composer](https://getcomposer.org).  
This will install the latest supported version:

```bash
$  composer require KiloSierraCharlie/DisclosureBarringService
```
## Configuration
When initiating the `UpdateServiceAPI` class you'll be required to pass the following details, which will be visible to the certificate holder:
|Variable         |Description                                     |Example          |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
|ORGANISATION_NAME|The name of your organisation.                  |ACME Inc.        |
|YOUR_FORENAME    |The forename of the person requesting the check.|John, Automated**|
|YOUR_SURNAME     |The surname of the person requesting the check. |Smith, Check**   |

Some organisations may wish to use generic details for forename and surname, particularly for automated checks - in this case, set the forename and surname as something recognisable and descriptive for the certificate holder.

## Example Use
You can use this package in a standalone fashion, or as part of a framework such as Symfony or Laravel. 
### Standalone Use
```php
<?php
use KiloSierraCharlie\DisclosureBarringService\UpdateServiceAPI;

$updateService = new UpdateServiceAPI( "ORGANISATION_NAME", "YOUR_FORENAME", "YOUR_SURNAME" );
$result = $updateService->getCertificateStatus( CERTIFICATE_NUMBER, "CERTIFICATE_SURNAME", DATE_OF_BIRTH );

$result->isCurrent(); #Boolean
$result->isClear(); #Boolean
```

### Symfony Use
Firstly you'll need to configure the service, the easiest way would be to use the AutoWire to pass environment variables. You could manually create an instance of `UpdateServiceAPI` in your class and pass these from a user object if required. 

**.env**:
```Dotenv
DBS_ORG_NAME=ACME Inc
DBS_FORENAME=Automated
DBS_SURNAME=Check
```
**services.yaml**:
```yaml
services:
    ...
    KiloSierraCharlie\DisclosureBarringService\UpdateServiceAPI:
        arguments:
            - '%env(DBS_ORG_NAME)%'
            - '%env(DBS_FORENAME)%'
            - '%env(DBS_SURNAME)%'
```

**In your controller/command etc**:
```php
use KiloSierraCharlie\DisclosureBarringService\UpdateServiceAPI;
...
#[Route('/check_dbs', name: 'check_dbs')]
public function check_dbs( UpdateServiceAPI $updateService, Request $request ){
    ...
    $result = $updateService->getCertificateStatus( $request->request->get("CERTIFICATE_ID"),
                                                    $request->request->get("CERTIFICATE_SURNAME"),
                                                    $request->request->get("DATE_OF_BIRTH")
                                         );
    return $this->json([
        'current' => $result->isCurrent(),
        'clear' => $result->isClear()
    ]);
}
```
